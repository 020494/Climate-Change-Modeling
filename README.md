# 🌍 Climate Change Modeling & Public Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes public sentiment on NASA’s Facebook posts related to climate change. Using text mining, sentiment analysis, and machine learning, it identifies emotional tones in comments and explores how environmental factors like temperature and CO₂ emissions influence public perception.


# 🎯 Objectives

- Classify public comments into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
- Use machine learning (Random Forest) to predict sentiment scores based on user engagement and 
  climate indicators.
- Explore emotional responses and trends in social media discourse related to climate change.
- Provide insights that help improve climate communication strategies.

# 🔍 Project Highlights

- Applied text cleaning, tokenization, and sentiment scoring (using TextBlob).
- Generated word clouds to visualize frequent emotional and environmental themes.
- Trained a Random Forest model to predict sentiment intensity using engagement metrics like likes and   
  comments.
- Capped outliers to reduce skewed predictions and improve accuracy.
- Scenario-based analysis to study the effect of environmental variables on sentiment.

# 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- NLP: TextBlob, NLTK
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Visualization: WordCloud, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 💡 Key Insights

- Emotionally strong comments attracted more engagement.
- Most comments were neutral, but both positive and negative sentiments influenced interactions.
- Outlier handling improved model accuracy.
- Environmental factors like CO₂ and temperature impacted public sentiment patterns.
